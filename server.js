/* 
Now these variables, they come from the process core module and we're set at the moment that the process started.
And as you see, we didn't have to require the process module right. It is simply available everywhere automatically.

Now in Express, many packages depend on a special variable

called node N.

So it's a variable that's kind of a convention

which should define whether we're in development

or in production mode okay.

However Express does not really define this variable,

and so we have to do that manually.
